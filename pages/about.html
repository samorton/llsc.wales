<h2>About Us</h2><img src="../img/puffin.jpeg"><p>
    If you like your seaside with a peaceful, period twist you’ll love Llanfairfechan.
    
    It’s a small Victorian resort that – in common with Llandudno across the bay – remains true to its roots.
    
    There’s a prom fronting a wide stretch of low-tide sands plus a range of retro facilities that include a boating
    lake
    and bowling green.
    <br/>
    And, as well as those traditional time-honoured ‘beside the sea’ pleasures Llanfairfechan is also popular with
    windsurfers and kitesurfers.
